-- Roblox Script for Arise Cross Over: AFK Rewards
-- This script awards players in an AFK server with a common item every 4 minutes.
-- In addition, there is a configurable chance to receive a bonus item named "Ziru".
-- The bonus item's chance can be set anywhere from 0.1% to 100%.

-- Configuration:
-- ziruChancePercent: Drop chance for the "Ziru" bonus item in percentage.
-- The value can be adjusted within the range [0.1, 100].
local ziruChancePercent = 10.0  -- example: 10% chance; modify as needed

-- Item names as stored in ServerStorage (they should be pre-made objects such as Tools)
local commonRewardName = "RewardItem"  -- Common reward item
